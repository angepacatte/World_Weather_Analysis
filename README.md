# World_Weather_Analysis
The project created a template for a vacation search.  It began with allowing a client to set their temperature criteria - high and low temperatures.  From there a search was performed with cities fitting the criteria from the 2000 latitude and longitudes first randomly selected.  From there maps were created with markers showin the cities information.  Then 4 cities were selected to create a vacation itinerary.  Maps of the trip and cities'info were created as well.
