# World_Weather_Analysis
This project created a template for a vacation search.  It began with allowing a client to set their temperature criteria - high and low temperatures.  From there a search was performed with cities fitting the criteria from the 2000 latitude and longitudes first randomly selected.  From there maps were created with markers showing the cities information.  Then 4 cities were selected to create a vacation itinerary.  Maps of the trip and cities' info were created as well.  See all code and images in the 3 folders included - weather_database, vacation_search, vacation_itinerary.
